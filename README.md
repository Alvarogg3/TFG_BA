This study investigates a pairs trading strategy using stocks from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) index. It entails estimating parameters, optimizing portfolios, and backtesting utilizing daily price data from 2003 to 2023. The technique seeks to profit from stock price mean-reversion by selecting couples with stable correlations.
A continuous cointegration technique and maximum likelihood estimation are used to estimate the model parameters. Stability requirements and cointegration tests are used to choose pairs. Using current portfolio theory, the estimated parameters, such as mean-reverting speeds and spread volatility, are used to design optimal portfolios.
Backtesting is used to analyze the performance of the strategy using metrics such as excess return, volatility, and Sharpe ratio. When stability prerequisites and cointegration constraints are met, the results show that the technique has the potential to provide consistent profits.
This research adds to our understanding of pair trading methods in the context of DJIA equities. The methods given here can be used by practitioners who want to implement comparable strategies. For successful pairs trading methods in practice, it emphasizes the necessity of accurate parameter estimate, portfolio optimization, and rigorous backtesting.
